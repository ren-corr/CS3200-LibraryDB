# CS3200-LibraryDB
CS 3200 Final Project by Trang Do, Ren Corr and Morgan Spencer

## Building Specifications
### Required Programming Languages
- Python
- SQL
### Required Libraries
- PyMySQL
- Pandas

### Required Software
- MySQL Workbench for reading the SQL codebase
- Terminal/Command Line for running the application

### Expected Files
- libraryDQ.sql : contains the code for building the library database (backend)
- main.py : contains the code for running the application overall (frontend)
- method.py : contains the code for the controller of the application along with the supported commands (frontend)

### Supported Commands
- **exit()** : exits the application
- **booksAvailable()** : shows all books available for immediate checking out from the library database
- **createHold()** : creates a hold on a currently checked-out book give the book's ID
- **bookCheckout()** : checks out an available book given its ID
- **returnBook()** : returns a currently checked out book given its ID
- **booksBorrowed()** : shows all books which are currently borrowed by the user
- **bookInfo()** : shows all info on the desired book given its ID
- **showComms()** : shows all supported commands in the application
- **login()** : log into the application given the username and password (to be implemented)
- **logout()** : log out of the application (to be implemented)
- **createUser()** : sign up as a new user to the application (to be implemented)
- **deleteUser()** : remove a user from the application (to be implemented)
- **addBook()** : add a new book to the application given all necessary information regarding the book (to be implemented)
- **removeBook()** : remove a book from the application given the book's ID (to be implemented)

## Lessons Learned
### Technical Expertise Gained
- Coding in Python and SQL while being able to integrate both to create an interactable database program

### Insights

### Contemplations/Considerations on the Approach of the Project

### Code not Working in the Project

## Future Work
### Planned Uses of the Database
- Example work to demonstrate understanding and application of Python and SQL

### Potential Future Functionalities
